# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Rust workspace for **Verified Trust Communities (VTC) - Verified Trust Agent (VTA)**. A Trust Agent manages keys and policies for a Verified Trust Community. Part of the [First Person Network](https://www.firstperson.network/white-paper) project.

## Workspace Structure

This repo lives at `vtc-vta-rs/vta-service/` within a two-crate workspace:

- **vta-sdk** (`../vta-sdk/`) — Library crate providing the SDK for Verified Trust Agents
- **vta-service** (this crate) — Binary service application

Both crates share configuration via `workspace.package` in the root `Cargo.toml`.

Key external dependency: `dtg-credentials` (Decentralized Trust Graph Credentials) — currently sourced from git (`https://github.com/FirstPersonNetwork/dtg-credentials-rs`), will move to crates.io when published.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build entire workspace
cargo build

# Check compilation (faster, no codegen)
cargo check

# Run the service
cargo run --package vta-service

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for a single crate
cargo test --package vta-service
cargo test --package vta-sdk

# Run a single test by name
cargo test test_name

# Lint
cargo clippy

# Format
cargo fmt
cargo fmt --check   # check only
```
