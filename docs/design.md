# VTA Service Design

This document describes the high-level architecture and design of the Verified
Trust Agent (VTA) service. The VTA manages cryptographic keys, DIDs, and access
control for a Verified Trust Community as part of the
[First Person Network](https://www.firstperson.network/white-paper).

## Workspace

The repository is a Rust workspace with three crates:

```
vtc-vta-rs/
  vta-sdk/           Shared types (KeyRecord, ContextRecord, protocol constants)
  vta-service/        Axum HTTP service (this document's focus)
  cnm-cli/            Community Network Manager CLI
```

`vta-sdk` defines the data model. Both the service and CLI depend on it so
request/response types stay in sync.

## Technology Stack

| Layer          | Choice                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Web framework  | Axum 0.8                                 |
| Async runtime  | Tokio                                    |
| Storage        | fjall (embedded LSM key-value store)     |
| Cryptography   | ed25519-dalek, ed25519-dalek-bip32       |
| DID resolution | affinidi-did-resolver-cache-sdk          |
| DIDComm        | affinidi-tdk (didcomm, secrets_resolver) |
| JWT            | jsonwebtoken (EdDSA / Ed25519)           |
| Seed storage   | OS keyring (keyring crate)               |

## Application State

All shared state lives in `AppState` (defined in `server.rs`):

```
AppState
  store            Store                                  fjall database handle
  keys_ks          KeyspaceHandle                         "keys" partition
  sessions_ks      KeyspaceHandle                         "sessions" partition
  acl_ks           KeyspaceHandle                         "acl" partition
  contexts_ks      KeyspaceHandle                         "contexts" partition
  config           Arc<RwLock<AppConfig>>                  runtime-mutable config
  seed_store       Arc<KeyringSeedStore>                   OS keyring for master seed
  did_resolver     Option<DIDCacheClient>                  DID resolution (None before setup)
  secrets_resolver Option<Arc<ThreadedSecretsResolver>>    VTA DIDComm secrets (None before setup)
  jwt_keys         Option<Arc<JwtKeys>>                    JWT sign/verify keys (None before setup)
```

The three auth fields are `Option` so the server can start before setup has
run. When `None`, auth endpoints return an error directing the operator to
run setup first.

Keyspace handles wrap fjall partitions and expose async CRUD via
`tokio::spawn_blocking`. Structured values are JSON-serialized.

Auth levels: **Auth** = any valid JWT, **Manage** = Admin or Initiator,
**Admin** = Admin role only, **Super Admin** = Admin with empty
`allowed_contexts`.

## Authentication

Authentication uses a DIDComm-based challenge-response flow:

```
Client                                 VTA
  |                                     |
  |  POST /auth/challenge {did}         |
  |------------------------------------>|
  |  {sessionId, challenge}             |
  |<------------------------------------|
  |                                     |
  |  Build DIDComm message:             |
  |    type: .../authenticate           |
  |    body: {challenge, session_id}    |
  |    from: client_did                 |
  |    to:   vta_did                    |
  |  Sign + encrypt (pack_encrypted)   |
  |                                     |
  |  POST /auth/ {packed_message}       |
  |------------------------------------>|
  |  Unpack, verify challenge+DID       |
  |  Look up ACL (role, contexts)       |
  |  Issue JWT + refresh token          |
  |  {accessToken, refreshToken, ...}   |
  |<------------------------------------|
  |                                     |
  |  Authorization: Bearer {JWT}        |
  |------------------------------------>|
  |  (protected API calls)              |
```

### JWT Claims

```json
{
  "aud": "VTA",
  "sub": "did:...",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "role": "admin",
  "contexts": ["vta", "mediator"],
  "exp": 1738000000
}
```

The JWT is signed with an Ed25519 key (PKCS8 v1 DER) stored in the config
file. Access tokens default to 15 minutes; refresh tokens to 24 hours.

### Session Lifecycle

Sessions progress through two states:

1. **ChallengeSent** -- created at `/auth/challenge`, expires after
   `challenge_ttl` (default 300s).
2. **Authenticated** -- set at `/auth/`, includes refresh token and expiry.

A background task runs every `session_cleanup_interval` seconds and removes
expired sessions from both states.

## Authorization Model

### Roles

| Role        | Capabilities                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin       | Full access; unrestricted when `allowed_contexts` is empty |
| Initiator   | Can manage ACL entries and view resources                  |
| Application | Read-only access to keys, contexts, config                 |

### Admin Types

The Admin role has two tiers based on `allowed_contexts`:

| Type          | `allowed_contexts` | Access                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Super admin   | `[]` (empty)       | Unrestricted: config, contexts, all keys and ACL |
| Context admin | `["vta", ...]`     | Keys and ACL within assigned contexts only       |

No additional role enum values are needed. The distinction is purely based
on whether `allowed_contexts` is empty.

### Super Admin Requirements

The following operations require super admin:

- **Contexts:** create, update, delete (`POST/PATCH/DELETE /contexts/{id}`)
- **Config:** update (`PATCH /config`)
- **Keys:** create or manage keys without a `context_id`
- **ACL:** create entries with empty `allowed_contexts`

### Context-Scoped Access

Each ACL entry carries an `allowed_contexts` list. When non-empty, the
holder can only access resources within those contexts. An Admin with an
empty list has unrestricted access (super admin). The list propagates into
JWT claims and is re-evaluated on token refresh.

**List filtering:** Context-scoped users only see resources that belong to
their assigned contexts:

- `GET /contexts` — only contexts in `allowed_contexts`
- `GET /keys` — only keys whose `context_id` is in `allowed_contexts`
- `GET /acl/` — only entries whose `allowed_contexts` overlap with the caller's

**Single-resource access:** `GET /contexts/{id}`, `GET /keys/{key_id}`, and
`GET /acl/{did}` validate that the caller has access to the resource's context.

### Privilege Escalation Prevention

Context admins cannot:

- Create or modify ACL entries with empty `allowed_contexts` (would grant
  super admin access).
- Grant access to contexts they don't have access to themselves.
- Generate credentials (`POST /auth/credentials`) with broader context
  access than their own.

## Key Management

### BIP-32 Hierarchy

All keys derive from a single BIP-39 mnemonic seed under `m/26'` (reserved
for First Person Network):

```
m/26'/2'/N'/K'
         |   |
         |   +-- Key index (sequential counter per context)
         +------ Context index (0=vta, 1=mediator, 2=trust-registry, 3+=user)
```

See [`bip32_paths.md`](bip32_paths.md) for the full specification.

### Key Types

- **Ed25519** -- signing, authentication, assertion. Multibase prefix `z6Mk`.
- **X25519** -- key agreement (Diffie-Hellman). Derived from Ed25519 private
  key via clamping. Multibase prefix `z6LS`.

### Key Record

```rust
KeyRecord {
    key_id:          String,          // "did:webvh:...#key-0"
    derivation_path: String,          // "m/26'/2'/0'/0'"
    key_type:        KeyType,         // Ed25519 | X25519
    status:          KeyStatus,       // Active | Revoked
    public_key:      String,          // multibase
    label:           Option<String>,
    context_id:      Option<String>,  // "vta", "mediator", etc.
    created_at:      DateTime<Utc>,
    updated_at:      DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

### Seed Storage

The master seed (64 bytes from BIP-39 or 32 bytes random) is stored
hex-encoded in the OS keyring under service `vta`, user `master_seed`.
It never touches disk.

## Application Contexts

Contexts group keys and DIDs into logical units:

```rust
ContextRecord {
    id:          String,          // slug: "vta", "mediator"
    name:        String,          // "Verified Trust Agent"
    did:         Option<String>,  // set after DID creation
    description: Option<String>,
    base_path:   String,          // "m/26'/2'/0'"
    index:       u32,             // position in hierarchy
    created_at:  DateTime<Utc>,
    updated_at:  DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

Three contexts are seeded during setup. Additional contexts are created via
`POST /contexts` and receive the next available index. Each context's keys
share a sequential counter so indices are unique within the context.

## DID Methods

### did:key

Simple, self-contained identifiers. An Ed25519 public key is multibase-encoded
to produce `did:key:z6Mk...`. Used for admin and application credentials
generated via `/auth/credentials`. The private key is returned as a base64
credential string that the holder imports into the CLI.

### did:webvh (Web Verifiable History)

Production identifiers for the VTA, mediator, and organizational entities.
Features:

- **Self-certifying** -- the SCID is derived from the initial DID document.
- **Portable** -- the DID can move between domains.
- **Pre-rotation** -- future key hashes are committed in advance.
- **Verifiable history** -- a signed log (`did.jsonl`) records every update.

A typical DID document includes:

- `verificationMethod` with Ed25519 (signing) and X25519 (key agreement) keys.
- `authentication` and `assertionMethod` referencing the signing key.
- `keyAgreement` referencing the X25519 key.
- `service` with a `DIDCommMessaging` endpoint routing through the mediator.

## DIDComm Messaging

The VTA uses DIDComm v2 for authenticated communication:

1. **Server side** -- at startup the VTA's signing and key-agreement secrets
   are loaded into a `ThreadedSecretsResolver`. Incoming DIDComm messages are
   unpacked with `Message::unpack_string()` which decrypts and verifies
   signatures using the DID resolver and secrets resolver.

2. **Client side** -- the CLI builds DIDComm messages with `from` (client DID)
   and `to` (VTA DID), packs them encrypted via `pack_encrypted()`, and sends
   the ciphertext as the HTTP body.

Message types used:

| Type URI                                            | Purpose            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `https://affinidi.com/atm/1.0/authenticate`         | Challenge response |
| `https://affinidi.com/atm/1.0/authenticate/refresh` | Token refresh      |

## Configuration

Configuration loads from a TOML file with environment variable overrides:

| Section   | Key Fields                          | Env Prefix     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| (root)    | vta_did, community_name/description | VTA\_          |
| server    | host, port                          | VTA*SERVER*    |
| log       | level, format                       | VTA*LOG*       |
| store     | data_dir                            | VTA*STORE*     |
| messaging | mediator_url, mediator_did          | VTA*MESSAGING* |
| auth      | token expiries, jwt_signing_key     | VTA*AUTH*      |

`vta_did`, `community_name`, and `community_description` are mutable at
runtime via `PATCH /config`.

## Setup Wizard

Running `vta setup` launches an interactive wizard that bootstraps the
service:

1. Collect server, logging, and storage configuration.
2. Create seed contexts (vta, mediator, trust-registry).
3. Generate or import a BIP-39 mnemonic; store seed in OS keyring.
4. Generate a random JWT signing key.
5. Create mediator did:webvh (signing + key-agreement keys, DID log file).
6. Create VTA did:webvh with DIDComm service pointing to the mediator.
7. Create admin identity (did:key credential, did:webvh, or existing DID).
8. Bootstrap ACL with admin entry.
9. Persist store and write `config.toml`.

The wizard is feature-gated behind `"setup"` so production builds can
exclude the dialoguer dependency.

## Storage Layout

All data lives in fjall keyspaces:

| Keyspace | Key Pattern                | Value                |
| -------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| keys     | `key:{key_id}`             | KeyRecord (JSON)     |
| keys     | `path_counter:{base_path}` | u32 (LE bytes)       |
| sessions | `session:{session_id}`     | Session (JSON)       |
| sessions | `refresh:{token}`          | session_id bytes     |
| acl      | `acl:{did}`                | AclEntry (JSON)      |
| contexts | `ctx:{id}`                 | ContextRecord (JSON) |
| contexts | `ctx_counter`              | u32 (LE bytes)       |

## VTA CLI

The VTA binary serves as both the HTTP server (when run without a subcommand)
and a set of offline management commands that operate directly on the store:

```
vta                                     Start the HTTP service
vta setup                               Interactive setup wizard
vta status                              Show config, contexts, keys, ACL, sessions
vta export-admin                        Export admin DID and credential
vta create-did-key --context ID         Create a did:key in a context
vta create-did-webvh --context ID       Create a did:webvh interactively
vta import-did --did DID [--role ...]   Import external DID into ACL
vta acl list [--context ...] [--role ...] List ACL entries
vta acl get <did>                       Show ACL entry details
vta acl update <did> [--role ...]       Update ACL entry
vta acl delete <did> [--yes]            Delete ACL entry
```

## CNM CLI (cnm-cli)

The Community Network Manager CLI is the primary network client:

```
cnm setup                               First-time setup wizard
cnm health                               Health check (community + personal VTA)
cnm community list|use|add|remove|status Multi-community management
cnm auth login <credential>              Import credential and authenticate
cnm auth status                          Show current session
cnm auth logout                          Clear session
cnm config get                           Show VTA config
cnm config update [--name ...] ...       Update config fields
cnm keys list [--status ...]             List keys
cnm keys create [--context-id ...]       Create key
cnm keys get <key_id>                    Get key
cnm keys revoke <key_id>                 Invalidate key
cnm keys rename <key_id> <new_id>        Rename key
cnm contexts list                        List contexts
cnm contexts get <id>                    Get context
cnm contexts create --id ... ...         Create context
cnm contexts update <id> [...]           Update context
cnm contexts delete <id>                 Delete context
cnm contexts bootstrap --id ... ...      Create context + first admin credential
cnm acl list [--context ...]             List ACL entries
cnm acl get <did>                        Get ACL entry
cnm acl create --did ... --role ...      Create ACL entry
cnm acl update <did> [--role ...]        Update ACL entry
cnm acl delete <did>                     Delete ACL entry
cnm auth-credential create --role ...    Generate did:key credential with ACL entry
```

The CLI caches authentication state (tokens, credential) in the OS keyring.
Protected commands auto-authenticate via challenge-response and refresh
tokens when the access token nears expiry.
